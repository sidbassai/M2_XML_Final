# Towards a digital edition of the Duluoz Legend

## Introduction
This project begins a digital encoding of Jack Kerouac’s personal œuvre, which he called the Duluoz Legend. While writing his novels Kerouac was forced by his publishers to use pseudonyms so as to hide the real identity of the people involved, so that they would avoid any legal problem. As such, Allen Ginsberg becomes Irwin Garden or Adam Moorad. Kerouac wanted a reedition of his books as a series in Proustian style, with the real names restored. The beginning of three novels is encoded here: *On the Road*, *Visions of Cody*, and *The Subterraneans*.

## Aims
Since a complete edition of the Duluoz Legend has never been produced either in paper or digital form, this would provide a first step in that direction. A digital XML-encoded edition would prove particularly useful because it allows to juxtapose the original texts with editions. It would allow to map out not only Kerouac’s literary world, but also the real world in which he and his friends evolved, the world of 50s-60s Beat America with its NY-to-SF cross-country road trips, its jazz clubs, and its poetry readings.

## Contents
-	Three XML files encoded following TEI guidelines of three books in the Duluoz Legend (*On the Road, Visions of Cody*, and *The Subterraneans*)
-	An ODD file that contains a more detailed explanation of the project and the choices that were made in the encoding, including guidelines for later improvements and complete encoding
-	Associated RNG and XHTML files
